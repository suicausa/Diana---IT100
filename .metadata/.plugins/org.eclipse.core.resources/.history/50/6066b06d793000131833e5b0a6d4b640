/*
 * File: Pyramid.java
 * Name: 
 * Section Leader: 
 * ------------------
 * This file generates a 2D pyramid of bricks in the center of the window.
 * With the constants of the brick dimensions (width and height), and the number of bricks in the base,
 * this program determines the bottom left point of the pyramid and begins piling bricks horizontally.
 * Once the base has been completed, it's position shifts up 1 brick height, and over half brick width
 * as the starting point of the second line of bricks.
 * The number of bricks per line decreases by one until there is only one brick, the peak of the pyramid.
 * At this point the program stops.
